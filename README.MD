This is a playlist app that stores albums and tracks for them, and pulls up Album art and a webview to play the track on youtube, it uses winforms for the UI and a mysql database
for storing the albums and tracks data. Mainly for practice and experimenting. You can add, delete, search and edit tracks and albums as well.

<h2><u><b>NOTE: </b></u></h2> the mysql database is hosted locally,
 I used MAMP to easily set up a local mysql database and make an albums and tracks tables. So if you wanted to you could do the same.
